<h2>Acknowledgement of Country</h2>
<p>The curator of this website has lived on the lands of: the <a href="https://yynac.com.au/">Yorta Yorta</a> nation; the <a href="https://wiradjuricc.com/">Wiradjuri</a> nation; and the <a href="https://www.wurundjeri.com.au/">Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung clans of the Kulin Nation</a> respectively.
<br/>
In the spirit of reconciliation, the owner, creator and maintainer of this site acknowledges the Traditional Custodians of Country throughout Australia and their connections to land, sea and community. I pay my respect to their Elders past, present and emerging, extending that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today.</p>
<p>Note: If you want to use your own acknowledgement of country, it is probably best to consult a government website that will contain up-to-date information on what is the best wording to use. At a base level, here are the <a href="https://www.indigenous.gov.au/contact-us/welcome_acknowledgement-country">Federal</a> and <a href="https://www.firstpeoplesrelations.vic.gov.au/acknowledgement-traditional-owners">Victorian Government</a> recommendations.</p>
