Here on this page you can find my affiliations with (and memberships of) companies and organisations I belong to at various levels and for various reasons.

## Australian Computer Society (ACS)
The [ACS](https://www.acs.org.au/) is one of Australia's largest organisational bodies of IT professionals.  It approves many of the information technology, computer and data science courses that are studied across the country.  I currently have a student membership with this organisation and have done some short courses with them.

## Blind Information Technology Specialists (BITS)
[BITS](https://bits-acb.org/drupal77/) is an organisation deticated to the fostering of career development for blind / VI computer / IT professionals, as well as promoting the use of technology by blind persons to improve their personal and professional lives.  I currently have a student membership with this organisation.

## Deakin Launch Network (DLN)
The [DLN](https://launchnetwork.deakin.edu.au/) is an organisation that fosters development of career and employment opportunities for people from disadvantaged or underprivileged situations, backgrounds and minority groups.  It creates material that promotes networking and other necessary skills for the workforce.  I have a student membership with this organisation.

## Eduvis
Eduvis is a not-for-profit organisation I have done some work for, seeking to provide material resources and practical strategies for students with a vision impairment who want to take up further study in mathematics and physical education at higher levels of secondary education; and potentially on to tertiary study.  Its website can be found [here](http://www.eduvis.com.au/) and the organisation's GitHub presence, of which I am a co-owner, can be found [here](https://github.com/eduvis/).  You can read further details of my work at [Contributions to Eduvis](/eduvis/).
