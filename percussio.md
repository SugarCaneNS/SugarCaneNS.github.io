## Music (Drums and Percussion)
![A picture of my first drum kit](/assets/images/legend_kit.jpg)

Music (especially rhythm and percussion) has often been a relatively big part of my life. Although my parents were and are not terribly musically inclined playing-wise, my sisters and I must have inherited some kind of gene somewhere, as both of them sing (one professionally), one plays guitar and one or both can play piano to an extent. When I was twelve-years-old, my parents bought me a [Legend](https://www.britishdrumco.com/legend-series) drum kit (pictured above) for my birthday &mdash; yes, I know, drummers will probably cringe at the thought &mdash; but it was a good start.

My first unofficial drum lesson was from Grant, one of my Dad's first cousins, shortly after I got my first kit in 2006. I recall him saying it only took me about 45 seconds or so to pick up a basic rock beat but don't ask me how I did that. When I went to high school the following year, I got lessons from one drum teacher in basic rudiments, then moved onto another music teacher who trained me in how to collaborate in a band context. Then I got most of my block of private drum kit lessons from Clint Leys and for a short time, one other drum teacher before I finished my schooling altogether.

In high school, I played in a school band called Soul Faction which played mostly, broadly in the funk genre. Between roughly 2009&ndash;2014, I played the drums for the music team at a baptist church I used to attend. And from 2017 or maybe 2018&ndash;2020, bfore COVID-19 hit the world scene, I played at the [Albury Presbyterian Churches](http://alburychurch.org.au/) [Morning Church](http://alburychurch.org.au/locations/church_morningchurch/) service.

In around 2012 or so, I purchased a [Pearl](https://pearldrum.com/) drum kit to go with some [Zildjian](https://zildjian.com/) cymbals I got for my birthday. It served me well enough, although as I was studying and living on campus, it didn't get used a lot. And then in 2021, I gave the kit to my cousin for Christmas, as I thought he would like it and that the kit would get more productive on-going use that way. I also could not fit the kit into my share house, so it wouldn't have been able to be used. But I got fidgety, so I started seeking out other options.

## Tabla

![A picture of me with my first Tabla set](/assets/images/pune_kakade_tabla_2022.jpeg)

[Tabla](https://www.melbournetablaschool.com/tabla.html) is the name usually given to a set of two percussive musical instruments originating from the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent). The playing of these drums is usually featured in northern Indian [Hindustani classical music](http://ccrtindia.gov.in/hindustaniclassicalmusic.php and sometimes (though less so often) in southern [Carnatic classical music](http://ccrtindia.gov.in/carnaticclassicalmusic.php). It can also be given to the daya (right-hand drum) which is the smaller of the two in the set, the other being the dagga, or baya . They are often played sitting cross-legged with the drums in front of the player and sitting on padded rings, allowing for more flexible movement for greater comfort and usability while playing. You can also swap the drums around if you are left-handed; however, the drums still have the same names with their different positions. It can be featured in both classical (especially northern) Indian and now increasingly, Western styles of music and is usually tuned to the tonic note of the musical piece in question.

My keen interest in this instrument was inspired by seeing [Pete Lockett](https://www.petelockett.info/ABOUT) play at [Frank Corniola](https://www.drumtek.com.au/frank-corniola/) and Drumtek's [Australia's 17th Ultimate Drummers Weekend](https://www.drummerstix.com.au/pdf/drumscene-oct09-audwroundup.pdf) in 2009 when I went with my dad. Pete is a world-renown percussionist who, among many other things, is possibly most well-known for composing and recording the percussion components of the soundtracks for five of the more recent 007 James Bond films, most notably and substantially, [Quantum of Solace](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830515/). He is also on the [International Advisory Board for Can-Do Musos](https://candomusos.com/about-us.php), a not-for-profit organisation for supporting musicians with disabilities. I was quite fascenated by his playing and had always wanted to know more. But for a long time, I suppressed my desire for knowledge and experience.

Then in around March 2022, I started taking lessons with Dr. Sam Evans, Ph.D at the [Melbourne Tabla School](https://www.melbournetablaschool.com/), who has an [Honorary Doctorate](https://www.samevans.net.au/masters.html) in classical tabla repertoire, as well as a [doctorate](https://www.samevans.net.au/phd.html) in Western contemporary integrations of Tabla. In July 2022, I purchased my first complete Tabla set from India direct and by August, I had received it with excellent product quality and delivery service, from [Somnath Kakade](http://www.somnathkakade.com/), a well-known Tabla manufacturer from the city of Pune, who makes tabla in Mumbai style.

It's going to be a long commitment journey: I'm told about twelve months before I can play in the [MTS anual concert](https://www.melbournetablaschool.com/events.html); and eighteen months before I am taught how to tune the drums. The technique is very complex and utterly unlike any drums I have played previously (acoustic drum kit and Djembe).

On this page, I intend to put info about any potential personal projects outside of my lessons. There may be videos, or music transcripts. Also anything I learn on the way, especially about where and how to purchase the drums, as new students tend to sometimes make presumptuous mistakes, spending a lot of money and regretting it for a while.
