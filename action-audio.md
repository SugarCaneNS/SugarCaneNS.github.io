[Action-Audio](https://action-audio.com/) is an initiative of [AKQA](https://www.akqa.com/work/tennis-australia/action-audio/), in partenership with [Tennis Australia](https://www.tennis.com.au/) and [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), being supported by [Blind Sports and Recreation Victoria](https://www.blindsports.org.au/who-we-are), as well as the [International Blind Tennis Association](https://www.ibtatennis.org/who-we-are). Action Audio works by turning spatial data from real time ball monitoring into 3D sound. The system emphasises ball movements and augments critical moments to allow blind and low vision audiences to follow the game without seeing the ball.

If you are into (and well-practiced in) interactive &mdash; especially first-person &mdash; audio game-play, you may find this a beneficial experience when coupled with audio commentary of sports games and matches such as tennis. If you are not so used to this kind of setup and process, it may be a little overwhelming for you. I personally don't mind it, but I tend to frequently go back to the original AO Radio audio stream when listening to the [Australian Open](https://ausopen.com) Grand Slam tennis matches in particular, as it tends to output the court audio from mono to stereo as well as commentary.. Try it for yourself and see what you think.

## Listen to the A-A Stream:
