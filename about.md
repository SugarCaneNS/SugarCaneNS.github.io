## WHERE AM I?!
Part of the answer to this question largely depends on your subjective interpretation of &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Is the intended recipient of this question, by 	definition, supposed to be you, the reader, or instead, is it me, the writer? Can it be both?

Perhaps you get to decide. Perhaps I get to decide. But tossing all that aside, ultimately you have reached the culmination of a few of the things that (within the online world; and sometimes the real world) occupy some of the time, energy and attention of the owner of this sub-domain, as per the title on the homepage. Peruse at your own pleasure, or peril; whatever tickles, or taunts, your tastes!

## Who am I?
I am lots of things, really, which over time may not be hard to discover. I was born totally blind. I have a hereditary condition called [Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/leber-congenital-amaurosis); a genetic eye condition which has damaged the retina in the back of my eye. Technically, mostly, my eyes can probably see perfectly fine and the visual part of my brain works fine. But all of the sent and received messages do not get through to (and from) my brain. I cannot see anything at all -- not even light.

I finished high school with a [Victorian Certificate of Education](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/results/Pages/vce-certificate.aspx) (year twelve); and studied technical production (sound production/audio engineering) at the Northern Rivers academy of Music towards the final period of my high schooling. AFter VCE, I Then studied a bachelor of Arts and then Psychological Science. After this, I began studying a [Bachelor of Computer Science](https://apps.deakin.edu.au/current-students-courses/course.php?course=S306&version=1&keywords=&study_level=&area=) at [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au/).

I have a semi-formal interest in theology. I have been playing the drums (acoustic drum kit) since the age of 12 and am currently learning to play [Tabla](https://www.britannica.com/art/tabla) and have taken up lessons with [Sam Evans](https://www.samevans.net.au/) at the [Melbourne Tabla School](https://www.melbournetablaschool.com/). I also enjoy reading (not well disciplined by genre), windsurfing, playing blind cricket, travelling to see new places, as well as many other things. I have obtained [Space Academy](https://www.spacecamp.com/space/academy) wings through the [SciVis](http://www.scivis.org/) program and [went skydiving in 2013](https://youtu.be/_SaK8kMQw4g?t=199)... I guess you could say that I'm a little adventurous.

## Focus - Why this Site?
There are a few features of this site you may be interested in:
* [Repositories](/repos/) and [affiliations](/orgs/): On this site I will list the primary repositories I am working (or have worked) on and the organisations I belong to. I will probably be mainly creating open-source projects. An open-source project is a program that basically has its code exposed to the world. People are allowed to examine the internal workings of how it operates, make modifications, re-distribute at their own leisure and sometimes you don't even have to give credit to the original developers (though I do this where possible). Open-source projects are clasified as &lsquo;free&rsquo;; that is, they are free, not just because you pay no fee but also because you are free to do (almost) whatever you want to the source code. See the [GNU General Public License, version 2.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html) for more details.
* My blog (accessed from the home page): This is intended to be an expressive container of things that I hope others in various circles may find interesting. Mainly it is a means of logging my development activity. This is a comment-free blog, partly because the blogging platform I use does not support such capability but also because there will be times where I will simply not have the time or energy to moderate public communication from that unpredictable populous of online entities that are present on the internet.
* Acknowledgements: I have compiled a list of various [testimonials](/testimonials/) that others have given of me. In addition, I have written an overview of my [contributions to EduVis](/eduvis/).
* [Percussion](/percussio/): a compilation of my endeavours and exploits in the area of rhythm and percussion, especially drumming.
* Other sites: This website also hosts some other sites relevant to other projects (not necessarily directly affiliated with the projects themselves):
  * [Camel](/camel/)
  * [Latex-access](/latex-access.github.io/)

Well, that's about all for now. I hope you enjoy your time here.
