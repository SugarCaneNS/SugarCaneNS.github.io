Part of the answer to this question largely depends on your subjective interpretation of &ldquo;I&rdquo;.  Is the intended recipient of this question, by 	definition, supposed to be you, the reader, or instead, is it me, the writer? Can it be both?

Perhaps you get to decide.  Perhaps I get to decide.  But tossing aside the terminological pedanticness of arguably [one of the most famous wizzards in history](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gandalf), ultimately, truthfully, you have reached the culmination of a few of the things that (within the online world; and sometimes the real world) occupy the time, energy and attention of the owner of this sub-domain, as per the title on the homepage.  Peruse at your own pleasure, or peril; whatever tickles, or taunts, your tastes!

## Who am I?
I am lots of things, really, which over time may not be hard to discover.  I was born totally blind.  I have a hereditary condition called [Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/leber-congenital-amaurosis); a genetic eye condition which has damaged the retina in the back of my eye.  Technically, mostly, my eyes can probably see perfectly fine and the visual part of my brain works fine.  But all of the sent and received messages do not get through to (and from) my brain.  I cannot see anything at all -- not even light.

Unfortunately, because of the unique and complicated way my life has panned out, I have basically semi-achieved a lot of things.  I finished high school with a [Victorian Certificate of Education](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/results/Pages/vce-certificate.aspx) (year twelve), studied technical production (sound / audio engineering) at the Northern Rivers academy of Music, then studied a bachelor of Arts and then Psychological Science at [La Trobe University Albury-Wodonga](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/aw/).  I am currently studying a [Bachelor of Computer Science](https://apps.deakin.edu.au/current-students-courses/course.php?course=S306&version=1&keywords=&study_level=&area=) at [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au/).  I have a semi-formal interest in theology.  I have done and enjoy rock-climbing, playing the drums, reading (not well disciplined by genre), windsurfing, playing blind cricket, travelling to see new places, as well as many other things.  When I was about three years old, I would frequently steal spoonfuls of sugar from my Aunty's (and I believe my maternal grandmother's) sugar bowl in the kitchen, while the less logical and practical adults were busy having deep-and-meaningful conversations about the weather.  I like to be practical, straight-down-the-line with no nonsense.

I consider myself to be a servant of the I AM.  The reason why I am where I am is because of the I AM.
  If you don't know what that means, you can either look it up and / or read some of my posts to try and figure it out.

## Focus - Why this Site?
Currently, there are two main features of this site:

* My blog: This is intended to be an expressive container of things that I hope others in various circles may find interesting.  Topics covered may include subjects as broad as disability, theology, politics, culture, ethics, software / coding endeavours, history, music, perhaps some very general posts about anything, references to other people's posts and ideas, etc.  This is a comment-free blog, partly because the blogging platform I use does not support such capability but also because there will be times where I will simply not have the time or energy to moderate public communication from the populous that is the internet.
* Repositories: the primary function of the website you are visiting is to be a community for computer programmers to discuss software they are developing.  So on this site I will probably list the primary repositories I am working (or have worked) on.  As my account is a free one, I will probably only be creating open-source projects.  An open-source project is a program that basically has its code exposed to the world.  People are allowed to examine the internal workings of how it operates, make modifications, re-distribute at their own leisure and sometimes you don't even have to give credit to the original developers (though I do this where possible).  Open-source projects are clasified as &lsquo;free&rsquo;; that is, they are free, not just because you pay no fee but also because you are free to do (almost) whatever you want to the source code.  See the [GNU General Public License, version 2.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html) for more details.

To be strictly accurate, this website is a publicly and freely licensed open-source project.  You can view the source code at ```https://github.com/njsch/njsch.github.io```.  If you know how to, you can clone the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) by adding &ldquo;.git&rdquo; to the end of the above link and download the code for offline use.

As for my motivation(s) for writing, I have thought about doing something like this for a while now.  I did not have time to do this while I was studying.  However, I do now have sufficient time to do something, so I am doing something, because well, I guess because I can.  And also, my uncle had suggested to me not too long ago that I should do something like a podcast, which sounds nice but requires a lot of production time and would probably not be very interesting for anyone else as a monologue.  So, I am here.

Well, that's about all for now.  I hope you enjoy your time here and consider it worth your while.
