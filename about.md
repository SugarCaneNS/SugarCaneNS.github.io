Part of the answer to this question largely depends on your subjective interpretation of `I`.  Is the intended recipient of this question, by definition, supposed to be you, the reader, or instead, is it me, the writer? Can it be both?

But laying aside an equally (I wish) terminologically pedantic nature of arguably [one of the most famous wizards in history](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Gandalf) essentially, truthfully, you have reached the culmination of a few of the things that (within the online world; and sometimes the real world) occupy the time, energy and attention of the owner of this sub-domain, as per the title on the homepage.  Peruse at your own pleasure, or peril; whatever tickles, or taunts, your tastes!

# Who am I?
I am lots of things, really, which over time may not be hard to discover.  I was born totally blind.  I have a hereditory condition called Leber's Congenital Amaurosis; a genetic eye condition which has damaged the retina in the back of my eye.  Technically, mostly, my eyes can probably see perfectlyu fine and the visual part of my brain works fine.  But all of the sent and received messages do not get through to (and from) my brain.  I cannot see anything at all -- not even light!

Unfortunately, because of the unique and complicated way my life has panned out, I have basically semi-achieved a lot of things.  I fshed high school with a Victorian Certificate of Education (year twelve), studied technical production (sound / audio engineering) at the Northern Rivers  academy of Music, then studied a bachelor of Arts and then Psychological Science at [La Trobe University Albury-Wodonga](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/aw/).  I have a semi-formal interest in theology.  I have done and enjoy rock-climbing, playing the drums, reading (not well disciplined by genre), windsurfing, playing blind cricket, travelling to see new places, as well as many other things.  When I was about three years old, I would frequently steal spoonfulls of sugar from my aunty's (and I believe my maternal grandmother's) sugarbowl in the kitchen, while the less logical and practical adults were busy having deep-and-meaningful conversations about the weather.  I like to be practical, straight-down-the-line with no nonsense.

I consider myself to be a servant of the I AM.  The reason why I am where I am is because of the I AM.
  If you don't know what that means, you can either look it up and / or read some of my posts to try and figure it out.

# Focus - Why this Site?
Currently, there are two main focuses of this site:

* My blog: This is intended to be an expressive thought-tank, containing things that I hope others in various circles may find interesting.  Topics covered may include subjects as broad as disability, theology, politics, culture, ethics, software / coding endeavours, history, music, perhaps some very general posts about anything, references to other people's posts and ideas, etc.  This is a comment-free blog, partly because the blogging platform I use does not support such capability but also because there will be times where I will simply not have the time or energy to moderate public communication from the populus.  Unfortunately, this also means that I cannot observe or track visiting traffic to my site.  But whether it does or does not bare any t will be shown to me when I appear before the I AM.
* My repositories: Even though it is not the main focus of the blog, the primary function of the website you are visiting is to be a community for computer programmers to discuss software they are developing.  This blog may be my main focus but for github.com itself, blogging is just an asside.  I may or may not do very much in  regard to software projects; however, this will be a feature.  As my account is a free one, I will probably only be creating open-source projects.  An open-source project is a program that basically has its code exposed to the world.  People are allowed to examine the internal workings of how it operates, make modifications, re-distribute at their own leisure and sometimes you don't even have to give credit to the original developers (though I do this where possible).  Technically, this website is a publically licensed open-source project.  You can view the sourcecode at https://github.com/SugarCaneNS/SugarCaneNS.github.io/.  If you know how to, you can clone the repository by adding `.git` to the end of the above link and download the code for offline use.

As for my motivation(s) for writing, I have thought about doing something like this for a while now.  I did not have time to do this while I was studying.  However, I do now have  sufficient time to do something, so I am doing something, because well, I guess because I can.  And also, my uncle had suggested to me that I should do something like a podcast, which sounds nice but requires a lot of production time and would probably not be very interesting for anyone else as a monologue.  So I am here.

Well, that's about all for now.  I hope you enjoy your time here and consider it worth your while.
