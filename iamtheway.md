## What is This?
the above statement is a Greek rendering, first in an English-lettered transliteration and then parenthetically in Greek letters themselves, meaning &ldquo;I AM the Way&rdquo;. It has a deep, rich theological meaning and history.
 
The phrase &ldquo;Ego eimi&rdquo; (&ldquo;I AM&rdquo;) is the Greek version of a Hebrew title, sometimes attributed to a name that the Judeo-Christian God uses for Himself in the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible. It is the way that He introduced Himself, [by Moses, through Aaron](https://www.gotquestions.org/Moses-and-Aaron.html), to the Hebrew/Jewish community, prior to the Israelite nation being delivered by Him from slavery out of Egypt just under three-and-a-half thousand years ago ([Exodus 4:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex+3%3A13-14&version=CSB)).

It is also a title that Jesus Christ boldly attributed to Himself on a few occasions, inferably declaring himself to be God incarnated in the flesh. The above statement in its totality is something that Jesus specifically said to His disciples (specifically his twelve close followers) in [John chapter 14 Verse 6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn+14%3A6&version=CSB):
&ldquo;Jesus told him [Thomas], &lsquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&rsquo;&rdquo;

In this particular instance, the big I AM title [probably cannot be directly, significantly and positively correlated](https://www.biola.edu/blogs/good-book-blog/2015/does-i-am-always-refer-to-god-in-the-gospel-of-john) with the associated statement. But it is used by Jesus to point his followers to Himself as the exclusive and sole means of access to God as the only path to the truth about how to obtain eternal life.

It is interesting that when the earliest Christians started communicating and living their message, they [appeared to self-identify (and were also quite happy to be identified by others) as those belonging to &ldquo;The Way&rdquo;](https://www.gotquestions.org/the-Way.html), even in spite of it being eventually used as a slanderous label against them in subjective evaluation of them being a Jewish &lsquo;sect&rsquo;. The community of people claiming to be followers of Jesus were called this before they were eventually called Christians. They were a &lsquo;Christocentric&rsquo; community (hermeneutics aside): they themselves and their name pointed to the person and work of a central figure. They were a people bound up in an identification with Jesus.

It is a title of sorts that has been used and abused in all kinds of places, by all varieties of entities, individuals and collective bodies alike. It is actually the title of [quite a good discipleship course](https://thewaydiscipleship.com/about/) I just completed in a connect group at [the church I attend](https://gracechristiancommunity.org.au/about-us), contributed by [Murray Capill](https://rtc.edu.au/who-we-are/staff/dr-murray-capill/), [Peter Adam](https://stjudes.org.au/peteradam/), [Marty Ford](https://au.thegospelcoalition.org/profile/marty-foord/), [Murray Campbell](https://murraycampbell.net/about/) and others.

It is also along these topical lines that some sources have been placed on this site which may be helpful to some.

## Confessional-theological Documents
### The 2nd London Baptist Confession of Faith (2LBCF)
The second London Baptist Confession of Faith is a document which was discussed, written and formulated in 1677 and then published when allowed in 1689 by Calvinistic Baptists in England, owing to situational relaxation of some religious freedom laws in England. It is a text in the big [[R]eformed](https://www.crossway.org/articles/10-things-you-should-know-about-reformed-theology-2/) tradition. A webpage copy can be found [here](/1689lbc/) and there are [various open-source copies of it](https://github.com/njsch/lbcf), accessible to screen readers, available on Github. Feel free to peruse at your own leisure.

## Bible Study Tools
### Professor Grant Horner's Bible Reading system
This is a system I have enjoyed using and found helpful in segmented form. Find out more about how it works and why it is beneficial [here](/horner/).

Pastor, author, blogger, thorough and prolific reviewer [Tim Challies](https://www.challies.com/brief-biography/) has also done a somewhat positive [review](https://www.challies.com/christian-living/ten-chapters-per-day/) and [follow-up reflection](https://www.challies.com/general-news/ten-chapters-per-day-follow-up/) on the system.
