The list below contains the repos of projects that I manage (may or may not include forks):
* [DFRobot_MQ7_CO_data_logging](https://github.com/njsch/DFRobot_MQ7_CO_data_logging): This is a purely personal, non-academic project that collates code from a number of places, allowing for comunication with (and collection of raw data from) a hardware gas-detection sensor, namely the [DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/) [MQ7 Analog Carbon Monoxide Sensor](https://core-electronics.com.au/analog-carbon-monoxide-sensor-mq7.html).  After collecting the data, it preserves it by periodically logging it to a series of [Comma-separated values (CSV)](https://www.csvreader.com/csv_format.php) files on an inserted SDHC memory card.  Has been tested and runs well on an [Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno) [r3](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) with an [Arduino-compatible data logging shield](https://www.jaycar.com.au/arduino-compatible-data-logging-shield/p/XC4536).  The sensor requires at least four pins (including the data logging) for this code to work (one analog, one digital, one 5v and one ground).
* [Latex-Access](https://github.com/njsch/latex-access): a software package written primarily in the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language, which provides line-by-line translation of mathematics and scientific symbols from [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) formatting into various types and languages of [Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) and speech.  Also provides many other features.  Useful for both lecturers / tutors in (and students of) various fields of mathematics, science and engineering.  Interfaces with [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) and [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) on [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/), as well as [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [BRLTTY](http://mielke.cc/brltty/) on Unix / [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).
  * Note: There are now at least three streams of the Latex-Access project.  The project repository that I manage has essentially been semi-officially depricated, primarily due to some unfortunate pragmatic issues that were created owing to my beginner's lack of experience with the Git VCS.  The [original project](http://latex-access.sourceforge.net) still gets very occasionally updated by co-founder Alastair Irving; and [Derek Riemer](https://derekriemer.com/) of [Colorado University](https://www.colorado.edu/) has [done some nice work](https://github.com/derekriemer/latex-access-matrix) extending my initial work with the NVDA add-on regarding its interaction with the L-A translator and matrix processor.
* [piLbc](https://github.com/njsch/pyLbc/) &ndash; Layout by Code for Python.  This is a fork of a [repository](https://github.com/jamalmazrui/pyLbc/) by [Jamal Mazrui](http://www.empowermentzone.com/), which creates a simple textual-code-based method of adding fairly simple GUIs, mainly dialogs, to Python software solutions, a bit like [WXGlade](http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/).  Not as sophisticated as its sister projects for AutoIt and the DotNet Framework.  Relies on [WXPython](https://wxpython.org/), [Py2exe](http://py2exe.org/) and [Odict](https://pypi.org/project/odict/).  A ```python -m pip install``` will work for all of the above dependencies.  Owing to certain discussions on the program-l [Freelists](https://www.freelists.org/) mailing list, I have actually forked this repo and have been sending pull requests, not to the original repo but to [Jim Homme](https://www.jimhomme.com/)'s [forked repository](https://github.com/jhomme/pyLbc).
