The list below contains the repos of projects that I manage (may or may not include forks):
* [Camel](https://github.com/njsch/camel/): This is a cross-platform edition of what I believe used to be an old [MS-Dos](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aguh) text-based console game; though I can't find any sources on this.  The idea is basically that you have to get across 200 miles worth of desert, starting with six drinks and seven days of travel, with different speeds you can travel and environmental obstacles.  Unfortunately, the original game was a bit on the racist side of things so I have modified it.  It was ported to the [BrailleNote mPower / Classic](http://support.humanware.com/en-usa/support/other_products/braillenote) by Louis Bryant, being written in [Rapid Euphoria](https://www.rapideuphoria.com/) - note that this site is flagged as dangerous by some antivirus software.  There also used to be a Windows-specific executable available on his website which no longer exists.  You can still download it from [The Audio Games Archive](https://www.agarchive.net/pages/devs/braillesoft.html) but consider yourself warned that multiple antivirus programs, such as [Norton Antivirus](https://au.norton.com/) and [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/), have also flagged this as containing dangerous / malicious content.  My aim was to create something both easier and safer to download and play.  So I translated the code from Euphoria to Python, in collaboration with [Damien Garwood](http://daygar.plus.com).
* [DFRobot_MQ7_CO_data_logging](https://github.com/njsch/DFRobot_MQ7_CO_data_logging): This is a purely personal, non-academic project that collates code from a number of places, allowing for comunication with (and collection of raw data from) a hardware gas-detection sensor, namely the [DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/) [MQ7 Analog Carbon Monoxide Sensor](https://core-electronics.com.au/analog-carbon-monoxide-sensor-mq7.html).  After collecting the data, it preserves it by periodically logging it to a series of [Comma-separated values (CSV)](https://www.csvreader.com/csv_format.php) files on an inserted [SDHC memory card](https://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2520/~/sd%2Fsdhc%2Fsdxc-specifications-and-compatibility).  Has been tested and runs well on an [Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno) [r3](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) with an [Arduino-compatible data logging shield](https://www.jaycar.com.au/arduino-compatible-data-logging-shield/p/XC4536).  The sensor requires at least four pins (including the data logging) for this code to work (one analog, one digital, one 5v and one ground).
* [eduvis.github.io](https://github.com/eduvis/eduvis.github.io/): This is the website that I built for [EduVis](http://eduvis.com.au/), with some help from one or two other people.  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) did most of the work automatically so it was pretty easy.
* [Latex-Access](https://github.com/njsch/latex-access) (now deleted): a software package written primarily in the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language, which provides line-by-line translation of mathematics and scientific symbols from [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) formatting into various types and languages of [Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) and speech.  Also provides many other features.  Useful for both lecturers / tutors in (and students of) various fields of mathematics, science and engineering.  Interfaces with [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) and [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) on [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/), as well as [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [BRLTTY](http://mielke.cc/brltty/) on Unix / [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).
  * Note: There are now at least three streams of the Latex-Access project.  The project repository that I manage has been depricated.  The [original project](http://latex-access.sourceforge.net) still gets very occasionally updated by co-founder Alastair Irving; and [Derek Riemer](https://derekriemer.com/) of [Colorado University](https://www.colorado.edu/) has [done some nice work](https://github.com/derekriemer/latex-access-matrix) extending my initial work with the NVDA add-on regarding its interaction with the L-A translator and matrix processor.
* [LibLouis](https://github.com/njsch/liblouis/): my fork of the [open-source Braille translator and back-translator](http://liblouis.org/) used by JAWS, NVDA, Orca and many other software solutions, both comercial and non-commercial alike.  Current personal updates (enhancements and fixes) include:
  - Improved support (as optimally as possible) for back translation within the classic (pre-UEB) English-UK (and near equivalent Australian English) Braille translation table. (View progress on the relevant [branch](https://github.com/njsch/liblouis/tree/njsch_issue_972), [issue - automatically closes upon closure of pull request](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/972) and [PR](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/pull/1017))
* [piLbc](https://github.com/njsch/pyLbc/) &ndash; Layout by Code for Python.  This is a fork of a [repository](https://github.com/jamalmazrui/pyLbc/) by [Jamal Mazrui](http://www.empowermentzone.com/), which creates a simple textual-code-based method of adding fairly simple GUIs, mainly dialogs, to Python software solutions, a bit like [WXGlade](http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/).  Not as sophisticated as its sister projects for AutoIt and the DotNet Framework.  Relies on [WXPython](https://wxpython.org/), [Py2exe](http://py2exe.org/) and [Odict](https://pypi.org/project/odict/).  A ```python -m pip install``` will work for all of the above dependencies.  Owing to certain discussions on the program-l [Freelists](https://www.freelists.org/) mailing list, I have actually forked this repo and have been sending pull requests, not to the original repo but to [Jim Homme](https://www.jimhomme.com/)'s [forked repository](https://github.com/jhomme/pyLbc).
* [Splashkit-core](https://github.com/njsch/splashkit-core): My fork of [Deakin University's all-purpose SDK for beginners](https://www.splashkit.io/).  Currently I either have added (or am in the process of adding) the following features:
  - Added [more complete developer documentation](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core/pull/121) for building Splashkit from source on Windows - must immensely thank Deakin's and Swinburn's [Assoc. Prof. Andrew Cain](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/andrew-cain) for his patience on that one...
  - Added [developer documentation with detailed instructions](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core/pull/137) on how to write new code and run tests for said code when creating extensions for the Splashkit core SDK itself, so that one no longer has to search through the code or send lots of emails and chats to find the answers.
  - Collaborated with [Hayley Hughes](https://blog.foxes.systems/about/), using the imperatively / structurally-extended procedural programming paradigm to add a [logging module](https://github.com/njsch/splashkit-core/tree/logging) to the core SDK, allowing for third-party applications written with Splashkit to integrate basic logging functionality for info and debugging purposes.  Messages can be written to either a text-based console or a plain text log file.
  - Potential todo: Use Object-orientated Development (OOP) to [add a preferably cross-platform speech and Braille library](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core/issues/113) to enable communication of third-party apps using Splashkit with screen-reader and / or Braille display APIs.  Possibly borrow from [Tolk](https://github.com/dkager/tolk) and / or [Accessible_output2](https://github.com/ctoth/accessible_output2).
  - You can view my [contributor rank](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core/graphs/contributors) and [up-to-date individually committed contributions](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core/commits?author=njsch) on the parent Splashkit core SDK repository.
* [vce-cas-consids-opts_vid-transcript-docs](https://github.com/eduvis/vce-cas-consids-opts_vid-transcript-docs/): This is the notes / transcript for an Eduvis / PRACB-related funded project, primarily culminating in a video presentation.  See [here](https://njsch.github.io/eduvis) and [here](https://eduvis.com.au/projects) for more information.
