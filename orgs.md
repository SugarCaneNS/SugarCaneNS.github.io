Here on this page you can find my affiliations with organisations I belong to at various levels and for various reasons.

## AES
The [Audio Engineering Society (AES)](https://aes.org) is an internationally-recognised association of audio engineers. I have a student membership with this organisation and within the [Melbourne section](https://aesmelbourne.org.au).

## [Past] ACS
The [Australian Computer Society](https://www.acs.org.au/) is the professional association for the IT sector in Australia. I used to have a student membership with this organisation, from around August 2020, when I studied Computer Science at Deakin University.

## Blind Information Technology Specialists (BITS)
[BITS](https://bits-acb.org) is an organisation I have a membership with, aiming to foster the career development of blind computer professionals; promoting the use of computer technology by blind persons to improve the quality of their personal and professional lives; and advocates for improved information access for all visually impaired people.

## Can-Do Musos
[Can-Do Musos](https://candomusos.com/about-us.php) is an organisation seeking to foster and support students with disabilities in their efforts as musicians, endeavouring to challenge existing perceptions about what people can do in their various unique situations. It was founded in 2013 by [Dom Famularo](https://www.domfamularo.com/), [Andrew Hewitt](https://www.drummerstix.com.au/) and others.

I am a member of this organisation's [global family](https://candomusos.com/profile-nathaniel-schmidt.php).

## Eduvis
Eduvis is a not-for-profit organisation I have done some work for, seeking to provide material resources and practical strategies for students with a vision impairment who want to take up further study in mathematics and physical education at higher levels of secondary education; and potentially on to tertiary study.  Its website can be found [here](http://eduvis.com.au/) and the organisation's GitHub presence, of which I am a co-owner, can be found [here](https://github.com/eduvis/).

Current Github organisation members: [Gavin Douch](https://github.com/Coedice) [Kyle Keane](https://github.com/kylekeane/), [Charlie Roberts](https://github.com/eduvis-charlie/) and [Nathaniel Schmidt](https://github.com/njsch/).
Other collaborators: Brandon Combridge, [Brian Coogan](https://github.com/briancoogan/) and Izaak Van Ree.
You can read further details of my work at [Contributions to Eduvis](/eduvis/).

## [Past] Students as Partners
Students as Partners is a Deakin University initiative, aiming to break down some of the barriers of interactions between students and academics.

### Students With Assistive Technology (SWAT)
The &lsquo;[SWAT team](/swat/)&rsquo; is a student-led initiative that has undertaken unit site testing, developed podcast interviews with other students with a disability, and advised and supported a range of students with assistive technology (AT) workarounds and knowledge. Their advocacy work is multifaceted and ranges from peer-to-peer interactions to making recommendations to university wide practices and procedures. As a Deakin Uni student user of AT resources, I was a member of this organisation.
