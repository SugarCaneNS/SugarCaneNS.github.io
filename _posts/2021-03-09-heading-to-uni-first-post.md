Just leaving this here for reference.  The [Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students (AFES)](http://afes.org.au/) has created a website called [Heading to Uni](https://www.headingtouni.info/), which aims to reach students who are either in high school level year 12 or and / or transitioning into university.  It intends to provide tools for helping students start their new life journey, to find a place for community and help renew or maintain purpose, especially as it relates to their Christian walk.

Today the staff [published one of my posts](https://www.headingtouni.info/blog/something-doubly-amazing).  They called it &ldquo;Something Doubly Amazing&rdquo;, which is not the title I gave but works well enough.  I hope it helps people get a tiny bit of an idea of what it is like to study on a campus with students in your course and people who also have the same beliefs as you.

Enjoy.
