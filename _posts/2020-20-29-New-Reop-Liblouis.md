Another new code repository has been added to my GitHub account: [LibLouis](https://github.com/njsch/liblouis/).  This is my fork of the [open-source Braille translator and back-translator](http://liblouis.org/) used by JAWS, NVDA, Orca and many other software solutions, both comercial and non-commercial alike.  Current personal updates (enhancements and fixes) include:
* Improved support (as optimal as possible) for back translation within the classic (pre-UEB) English-UK (and near equivalent Australian English) Braille translation table.
