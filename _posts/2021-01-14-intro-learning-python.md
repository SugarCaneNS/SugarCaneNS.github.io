I recently started participating in a new and somewhat experimental course called [Learning Python](http://learningpython.siteweaver.org/).  It is a course that anyone could do but it is specifically tailored for blind and vision impaired learners.  It is meant for anyone and the current learner base contains a whole range of people, from the absolute beginner to postgraduate IT and cyber security majors.

It is taught by [Dr. Bryan Duarte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-duarte-b37bb7b1/) of [Arizona State University](https://cubic.asu.edu/content/bryan-duarte).  Workshops are conducted on Zoom each week and there is a mailing list where both announcements and discussion threads are posted, which can be joined [here](http://learningpython.siteweaver.org/mailman/listinfo/python_learningpython.siteweaver.org).

So far, only one session has been conducted, where the participants have mainly introduced themselves and done some very introductory work with the [Python Shell (console)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html), being introduced to very basic [types](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/) with [variable names and assignments](https://realpython.com/python-variables/).

The sessions appear to be pretty easy-going and not too fast-paced.  I would recommend it for anyone who would like to either learn the language, or at least more solidly consolidate one's Python knowledge.
