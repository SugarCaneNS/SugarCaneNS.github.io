I have just [forked](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#fork) a new software code repository to my GitHub individual user account.  It is called [PyLBC](https://github.com/njsch/pyLbc) (Layout by Code for Python).  Essentially it is a very basic [GUI](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/chi.html)-creation tool.  It allows a person to create fairly simple dialogs, windows and controls for receiving and interpreting information from the [end-user](https://techterms.com/definition/enduser) to the computer.  It can be used in conjunction with other modules and packages to create small-scale applications for practical use by anyone.

The only two direct contributions I have made thus far have been minor updates to  provide [backwards-compatibility](https://www.w3.org/People/Bos/DesignGuide/compatibility.html) between the two most widely-used versions of the programming language PyLBC is written with and for, namely the stable but [now legacy](https://pythonclock.org/) [Python version 2.7](https://legacy.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) and the much newer [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/), which is still under on-going development.  For some reason, the programs created with PyLBC still won't compile to machine language with Py3, so this is a work-in-progress.  But it more-or-less works now if one runs from source.

I have sent pull requests to the main developer and one other person but for now, the code can only be accessed within my own fork.
