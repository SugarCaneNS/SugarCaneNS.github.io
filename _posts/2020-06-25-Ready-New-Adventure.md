There aren't too many works of fiction where both the book(s) and the movie(s) sit pretty close to the top of my list of favourite things to read, watch and especially re-watch.  Although [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://www.tolkiensociety.org/author/biography/)'s classic fantasy work &ldquo;[The Lord of the Rings](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings)&rdquo; would be a definite exception to that unofficial rule.

The first time I was introduced to the story of the concluding history of the one ruling ring was when my great Aunty and Uncle gave me an analogue cassette tape collection ([Remember those, youngsters?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape)) of the [BBC's audio Dramatisation](https://www.audible.com.au/pd/The-Hobbit-Dramatised-Audiobook/B00FEZGQ40) of &ldquo;[The Hobbit](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hobbit)&rdquo;.  I was probably too young (about 6-7 yrs-o) when I was first given it and listened to it  &endash; I distinctly remember just not listening any further about half way through the first time.  But over the years, I have grown to really love the prequel and its very richly-developed sequel.  It is an amazing series of interwoving genres and literary complexities of narrative, poetry, adventure, friendship, romance and personality.  If you've been living in a cave and never read the books or watched the movies then I would strongly recommend you do both.

It is somewhat similarly along these lines that it was saddening to hear that actor Sir Ian Holm, famous for his roles in [Chariots of Fire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/) and as &lquo;<i>old</i> [Bilbo](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins)&rsquo; in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies, passed away last week.  Although he did not have a terribly lengthy role to play in either of the latter two movies, his contribution to each was an important and unforgetable one.

One of his key involvements was in probably one of the most moving scenes in LOTR, namely the journey to and from the Grey Havens.  In this scene, it is revealed that the elves of Middle Earth have given a special honour to two hobbits, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins.  Instead of indefinitely remaining in Middle Earth for the rest of their lives, they get to take the westward journey across the sea where, as other parts of the book indicate, they would encounter a land completely free of evil, pain and sadness.  At one point while they are at the ocean, Bilbo, seeming satisfied and perhaps a little excited, says: &ldquo;I think I'm... quite ready for another adventure!&rdquo;  Ultimately, they get on a ship and head west over the sea, leaving some of their friends behind.  You can watch the scene below:

It is an adventure very much like this that we all must take at some point, where we will finally find out whether or not there is anything to expect, discover or happen on the other side of life (or death).  Nobody can avoid it in any way, no matter how much we may sometimes try to do this.  It is an &lsquo;adventure&rsquo; that Ian Holm has now taken, leaving his family and friends behind; and he will not be able to come back, regardless of whether he wants to or not.

It is a [very old Hebrew saying](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+1%3A2&version=NIV) that: &ldquo;&lsquo;Meaningless! Meaningless!... Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.&rsquo;&rdquo; What is life supposed to mean when it's all over and there is no longer anything to gain in, or from, this current life? What happens when you leave behind any fame, renown, fortune, work, charity, family and / or friends, being unable to take it with you? What if that question is ignored and the answer is found too late?

The answer given by the author mentioned above is this:
<blockquote>
Now all has been heard;
    here is the conclusion of the matter:
Fear God and keep his commandments,
    for this is the duty of all mankind.
For God will bring every deed into judgment,
    including every hidden thing,
    whether it is good or evil.
</blockquote>
([Ecclesiastes 12:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+12%3A13-14&version=NIV))

In this unpredictable and sometimes tumultuous season, it can be sobering to think about things like death.  For some it may have been closer than they ever previously anticipated.  For others, they may have only just escaped by the skin of their teeth.  Perhaps there actually are some people who have never given it a first, let alone second, thought.  But as  complicated as life might seem sometimes, life is also very short and unpredictable.  At some point in our lives, every single one of us will probably be asking questions like: Where do I come from? Why am I here? How should I live? And where am I going? The explicit application of the text mentioned above is that every human being in on Earth has a conclusive obligation to watch their lives and allow for accountability.  It goes so far as to assert that such watchfulness and accountability is founded upon and will occur according to the commandments of God.  Will you test that assumption?
