Back in the early-mid 1950s, during the commonly-labeled and heavily American-influenced &lsquo;[Golden Age of Radio](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Golden-Age-of-American-radio)&rsquo;; and before television largely took over production of dramas and soap operas, for just over two years, listeners of the [NBC Radio Network](https://guides.loc.gov/nbc) were entertained by the old-time radio show &ldquo;[Tales of the Texas Rangers](https://www.texasranger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/History-Tales-of-the-Texas-Rangers-II.pdf)&rdquo;.  Starring the late [Joel McCrea](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566948/) as Ranger Jace Pearson, who by this time had become quite well-known for his acting role in Western films, it reported to re-enact actual accounts of events occurring in real investigations undertaken by [Texas rangers](https://www.dps.texas.gov/TexasRangers/texasrangershistory.htm), with the obvious exceptions of name, date and location changes, as well as imposing a somewhat modern mechanical and electronic feel with the inclusion of scenes involving motorised vehicles and telephones.

The show had many of the good quality things that a producer would need in order to market such a primarily audio-driven enterprise of its kind: a [very catchy intro and outro theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Zav9qzwzo), a dramatic soundtrack, good quality voice actors, a well-written plot and accurate emulations and recordings of ambient environmental sound effects.  It became popular enough that a TV show was [made along the same themes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047781/) from 1955, running for four years.  It can be heard today, along with many other shows like it, on radio stations that still play OTR shows, such as the [ROKiT Classic Radio Network](https://rokitradio.com/), the [ACB Radio's Treasure Trove](http://www.acbradio.org/trove) and [Mushroom Escape](https://mushroomfm.com/escape).

Sometimes this show has come on quietly in the background while I've been studying and doing assignments for uni.  At some point a few months ago, the thought struck me that with [only a very few exceptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN-sL-ymcKQ), nearly every single episode involves more than just murder in general but specifically killing with a gun.  Only occasionally is there an instance of theft, or some other crime, or even any other alternative type or method of killing.

In some ways this makes perfect sense.  After all, the Texas rangers are not directly equated with the police department but are brought in when extreme, unique and often dangerous situations occur that are not always easily and quickly solved by the state police force itself.  And there is always the consideration that a program director and / or producer probably desires to market their product to an audience that wants fast-actioned in dynamic entertainment.

But it still causes one to wonder if it is not an unproductive consideration to hypothetically consider what would have happened &ndash; and would be happening &ndash; if laws had been put in place to thoroughly regulate who is allowed to possess what kinds of guns, as well as how and why they should use them? Would there be as many murders and of what types in direct proportion to one another? Would there have been as many murderers killed &lsquo;on-the-job&rsquo; rather than in the chair or by means of lethal injection, ensuring that they could actually, consciously experience the consequences of their actions in a more prolonged and public sense? What would happen to the likelihood of immediate danger encountered by a ranger legitimately licensed to carry a gun? How much harder might it have been to successfully pull off a bank robbery?

One time when I went to America in 2009 to attend the [Space Academy](https://spacecamp.com/space/academy) through the [SciVis](http://www.scivis.org/) program (stayed in both California and Alabama), one of the things we did as eager tourists was go to Walmart.  I don't remember whether we even had a reason to be there &ndash; I think we just decided for the sake of novelty to see what it was like.  Most of it was pretty typical of what you would expect to find in certain shopping centres, except for one thing: the guns.  A specially dedicated isle, with rows upon rows of guns, ready for the picking.  It was amazing to the point of unbelievable.  I will never forget it.

I am not here to argue that the TRD, being one of the oldest  and most famous law enforcement agencies in U.S. history, should be done away with which certainly has been argued and temporarily enforced in the past.  But this issue of guns and the associated consequences seems to be an age-old problem that the United States cannot get over.  No matter how many shootings take place; no matter how many innocent people die unnecessarily, the right to bear arms is continually interpreted to mean that one can just walk into a store and pick up a gun, as if it is nothing more than... well... a ripe cherry for the picking.

there are many in Australia and throughout the world who would well remember the [Port Arthur Massacre of 1996](https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/port-arthur-massacre).  It was a massive incident that shocked a lot of people.  But it also motivated one of the quickest and most substantial responses to gun ownership in the world; even from a [fairly politically conservative](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22media/pressrel/2YZI6%22) government and Prime Minister.

The results were quite significantly positive and practical (You can view a somewhat amusing but still rationally viable interaction regarding the impact of gun control in Australia in view of not so strong U.S. legislation not going through the legislature below):

Unfortunately, certain political entities in the US still seem a little slow to learn that it does actually save lives &ndash; and does not very significantly encroach on others' freedoms &ndash; when a government chooses to implement policies that heavily regulate the types of guns that people are allowed to own.

Perhaps, in time, someone will listen and / or a new government will be voted in that will make some well overdue changes.  But until that happens, the world will probably keep frequently holding its breath until the next desasterous massacre occurs on U.S. soil.  this post was actually begun a little while before the increased build up to the 2020 federal election.  But perhaps it is as good a time as any to be thinking about some of the things that may remain important to think about (and potentially act upon) as the events of the next several weeks, months and years go by.
