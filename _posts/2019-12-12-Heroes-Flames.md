Australia is [in for a very hot summer, probably hotter than average](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/about-us/our-districts/mid-lachlan-valley/latest-news/climate-overview/).  We had been [forewarned](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/28/bushfire-season-australia-warned-to-prepare-early-amid-grim-outlook/) about it quite early on.  And starting in [September](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/06/homes-destroyed-as-four-out-of-control-bushfires-burning-across-nsw/), the predictions have not been disappointed.  The country has been hit in full force and it is only the beginning of summer.  Who knows what the future may bring.  But it is looking like a wave of largely unstoppable destruction is still on its way, in addition to what has already occured.  It has sparked all sorts of debates about the &lsquo;true&rsquo; causes of bushfires, especially, for instance, whether climate change is to blame; a debate that is going to continue for quite some time.  Long drought, which has been causing the water supplies of towns to regress, means that there is ever-decreasing amounts of water to throw on impacted areas.

But in the midst of all this increasing turmoil, there is &ldquo;... the resolve<br>
Of the fathers and the mothers;<br>
of the daughters and the brothers,<br>
saving strangers who would never know their names:<br>
they are the heroes of the flames.&rdquo;

The above comes from a song by country music artist [Colin Buchanan](https://colinbuchanan.com.au/pages/about-us/).  I have no idea what the exact context is for its lyrics.  But it seems a very contemporarily relevant reflection on the people who (especially voluntarily) fight these fires, who  have to be some of the most resolute people I have ever known.  My paternal grandfather and one of my uncles, as well as a couple of other friends of mine have their own positions within the Victorian [Country Fire Authority (CFA)](https://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/).  This post is a tribute (though small in comparison) to the tireless effort that they put in every year, every season, to keep ourselves and our homes safe.  Contained below is the full song &ldquo;The Heroes of the Flames&rdquo;.
