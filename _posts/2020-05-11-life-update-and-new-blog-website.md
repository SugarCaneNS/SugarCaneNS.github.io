It's been a while since anything has been posted here.  I've been a bit pre-occupied.  There are some posts locally stored but most are half-finished and I haven't done anything about it.

There is one big life change though that also happens to change some things about this site: I have enrolled and in two months, will be studying a [Bachelor of Computer Science](https://apps.deakin.edu.au/current-students-courses/course.php?course=S306&version=1&keywords=&study_level=&area=) at [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au/).  Basically this means that there are some people who might say I am becoming an official nerd.  I have basically chosen a degree which is kind of arguably between an information technology degree and a software engineering degree.  This necessarily means a couple of pragmatic things have to be announced:

* More than likely, my personal [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, where I host the content of this site and its sub-domain, is gradually going to become professionalised.  This may not directly affect the blog too much but a certain amount of traffic will come from my programming activity on the platform, because this is what it is really meant for.  Theoretically, an active GitHub account makes you look better in the eyes of a potential future employer, so this may be a bit of a focus, especially as my professional academic and practical knowledge increases.
* Consequently, I have changed my GitHub username to something that is hopefully easier to remember and easier to type into URLs for repositories (though I'm sure most people like to copy and paste anyway).  I really wanted to use NJSchmidt because this is my Deakin username.  But apparently my name is too popular and one of the 40m+ GH users has already [kindly stolen that one](https://njschmidt.github.io).  So I have gone with njsch (initials of my full name plus the second and third letters of my surname at the end).  Trust me, the difference between five and eleven characters makes a huge difference!
* Unfortunately, changing my GH username means that the URLs for all of my software and website project repositories have all changed as well.  So I updated my Google Feedburner rss blog reader to reflect these changes; however, this now means that I have lost all of my previous email subscribers from Feedburner.  So if you want to keep reading then you will have to re-subscribe.
* Having a new repository means having a new website at a new subdomain.  The new website is: <[https://njsch.github.io/](https://njsch.github.io/)>.

The Facebook page and its username are still the same and point to the new site.

Well that's a wrap, pretty much.  I've got lots of stuff to do to get ready for the next several months.  So this might be all there is for a while, again.
