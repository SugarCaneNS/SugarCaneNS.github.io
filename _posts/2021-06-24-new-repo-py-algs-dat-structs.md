A new software project repository has been [added to my Github profile](https://github.com/njsch/py_algs-dat-structs/).  As per the title of this post, it is intended to be a coded container of different types of algorithms and data structures that will probably be fairly strictly implemented in the dynamically-orientated, loosely-typed, high-level [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/).

Hopefully This repo will grow over time.  Currently, it contains some tests for a circular [linked list](https://realpython.com/linked-lists-python/) I implemented today.

Watch this space...
