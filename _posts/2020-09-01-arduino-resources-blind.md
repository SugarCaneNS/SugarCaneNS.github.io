It seems, thankfully, that there are already a number of resources available to the blind and vision impaired (VIP) community regarding the use of hardware single computer boards such as Arduino UNO and other similar products.  Among the most noteworthy would be the [Blind Arduino Blog](http://blarbl.blogspot.com/), [Blind Electronics](http://www.blindelectronics.com/) and the research-orientated [Blind Arduino Project](https://www.ski.org/project/blind-arduino-project).

Mostly these are quite helpful for independently navigating the physical layout of boards, connecting wires, etc.  They are left here as a hopefully helpful compilation; though a google search should turn up these results anyway.

I did want to add one final note on board orientation.  Mostly you can figure it out from the description given on the Blind-Arduino Blog; but there could be one added helpful note made, namely that to orientate the board correctly, the power supply port should be on the top-left and the USB port should be on the top-right.

It's been an interesting journey trying to figure some of this stuff out.  My hope is mainly that by referencing these links here, combined with some meta tags on this site and Google's layered search algorithm, it may be more likely that these resources will pop up in search results, hence the somewhat abruptness of this post.
