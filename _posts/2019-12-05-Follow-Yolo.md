More than likely, unless you've been living in a cave somewhere in the middle of nowhere, you have probably heard of the term &quot;<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YOLO_(aphorism)"> YOLO </a>&quot;.  This idea that (apparently) <i>you only live once</i> is so inherently entrenched into our society at large that it would be no exaggeration to suggest that the vast majority of people probably take it completely for granted.  According to the  article referenced above from the all-reliable Wikipedia, even though the phrase has been around for over a century, it seems to have increasingly escalated since about 2012.  It seems to encapsulate everything in life, from the most mundane of every-day tasks to the most daring of dares.  The idea seems to be that we never know which moment could be our last.  Therefore, we must be living (or should live) our best life now.  The here-and-now is as good as it will ever get.  It springs to mind unhealthy books like Joel Osteen's `Your Best Life Now`, as well as other titled along similar lines.
(to see why I do not endorse the above book, take a look at [this very good review](https://www.challies.com/articles/the-bestsellers-your-best-life-now/) by author and blogger [Tim Challies](https://www.challies.com/).

These thoughts entered into my mind as I saw a post from a Facebook acquaintance who had openly asked for peoples' opinions regarding a meme they had seen, which had been re-posted via cognitive and neuropsychologist [Dr. Caroline Leaf](https://drleaf.com/pages/about-dr-leaf):
<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdrleaf%2Fposts%2F10156523028411078%3A0&width=500" width="500" height="613" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

For those who cannot see the text of the photo, it states:
```You’ve gotta start romanticizing your life. you gotta start believing that your morning commute is cute and fun, that every cup of coffee is the best you’ve ever had, that even the smallest and most mundane things are exciting and new. you have to, because that’s when you start truly living. that‘s when you look forward to every day.```

I am sure that whoever put this meme together had good intentions and wanted to send a helpful message.  But that's just it: is it sending a truly helpful message? Does it really help to give one a more positive outlook on life; that life is more exciting, if one would just treat every moment as if it were the greatest out of all other moments? Is it true that if we believe things are better, that they will then, at the very most, actually get better? Or at the very least, that we will feel better?

I suspect such questions would produce mixed answers from the populous.  Unfortunately, as nice as it may sound in theory, more than likely it is actually a rather unproductive – perhaps even destructive – way to think.  There are a number of factors, or even consequences, worth considering in light of the above assumptions:
* The whole approach to life in this instance is only a very temporary escape from reality.  It creates a distraction from life's problems and circumstances, rather than allowing one to be honest with oneself about how genuinely good or mild, or bad, something really is.
** Consequently, it could cause a person to end up feeling even worse than they did before.
* It superficially seals the deal, providing [confirmation bias](https://dictionary.apa.org/confirmation-bias/) for anyone who already believes that life will be better if you simply think, or believe, that it will be so.
* It does not genuinely teach (or give a person) any authentic impression that they are valued or esteemed in any way.  It is almost, if not actually, a form of self-absorption, or even [idolatry](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idolatry).  It puts oneself at the centre of the universe, allowing ones thoughts, if not actions, to supposedly demonstrate that one individual has the power to autonomously, almost magically, change the world.
* In a big way, we do not live our best life now.  We do not only live once and then die once.  As someone who holds to a [Christian](https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-a-Christian.html) worldview, seeing this as the best explanation for how the world operates, I believe that `it is appointed for people to die once?—?and after this, [to face] judgment` ([Hebrews 9:27](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/HEB.9.27.CSB)).  I believe that people have an opportunity to die once and live twice, or to live once and die twice.
 
 On a more <b>positive</b> note, it is a good idea to be grateful for things that we have in life: good things because they are a blessing and bad things because they can teach us lessons.  But it is also beneficial to us that we find practical solutions that really do help us in our daily lives.

## Is there a Solution?
There are possibly much more practical solutions to approach one's attitude towards life.  One could simply be honest about the way things really are.  IN addition, it is good to be prepared for just about anything.  In some circumstances, it is good for even the most optimistic as well as a cynical person to be prepared for the worst when life does not go as planned.  To set goals for things that need to be done, or that could cater for future situations.

Are you prepared for the things, even difficult things that life may throw at you? Am I prepared for the things that life may throw at me?
