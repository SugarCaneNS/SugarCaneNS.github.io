<blockquote>
At a church... on the outskirts of Capetown, Mr. Lizzermore was attending his granddaughter's christening. Half-way through the service, he felt a sudden urge to leave. He ran a hand through his unruly grey hair, trying to subdue the instinct that something was wrong. But he couldn't settle. Lizzie made his excuses to his wife and he climed into his pickup to drive home.
<p>
A few minutes later, he arrived at his Cape Dutch house.  He climed the steps to the porch and fumbled with the keys &ndash; the unease had not subsided.  When he walked through the door, the phone rang.
<br>
&ldquo;Hellow, is that Mr Lizzermore?&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, hellow.&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;It's Sean Walker. Sven is okay.&rdquo;
<br>
Lizzie birst into tears.

The above quotation is an excert from a book I read relatively recently, called &ldquo;[Last Man Off](http://lastmanoff.com/)&rdquo; by [Matt Lewis](http://lastmanoff.com/bio/4543331072).  Published by [Penguin Random House](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/196/196399/last-man-off/9780241967447.html), it details the dramatic account of a South African fishing trawler that sank in sub-Antarctic waters off the coast of South Georgia, on Saturday, the 6th of June 1998 (the beginning of the Antarctic winter)! Lewis was a recently-postgraduate biology student who had been assigned to the trawler as a scientific observer.  Unfortunately, none of the experienced crew had any substantial plans for escape if the boat sunk, so Lew, drawing on his own previous experience on other boats, organised the abandon ship procedure at the last minute.  It's a pretty intense story, and not everyone survived, probably mainly due to the cold weather and equally freezing water.

But it is this little anecdote that fascenates me, which I now draw some attention to.  (It came from an audio book, so it won't be accurate to the punctuation).  Practically by his own admition, Lewis did not appear to consider himself to be an overly religious, let alone superstitious, person.  It is an account very much like lots of things you could probably dig up on the internet, even with only a superficial Google search.  It is a prime example of what some people would call &lsquo;[impressions](https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B170612/are-mental-impressions-divine-revelation/)&rsquo;; in other words, a mental notion that something is going to happen in the world (whether good or bad), or that something should be done by someone as a result.  IN this case, a relative of a crew member of the ship Lewis was on had a feeling that something was wrong, even though he lived thousands of miles away and had no way of knowing without direct communication by phone, or in a very limited instance back in the 90s, the internet.

Sometimes people report these things to come in the form of dreams or visions.  Within the last week or so, [BBC Radio 4 Extra](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4extra) aired an audio drama by Don Shaw, called &ldquo;[Greater Love](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06sfw7d)&rdquo;.  It recounts the true story of a village in England, where many people died from an outbreak of Bubonic [Plague](https://www.medicinenet.com/plague_facts/article.htm) from 1665 - 1666, as told by the Anglican minister of that time and his wife.

At one point, when the crisis was getting worse, they had a village meeting.  One of the villagers, a certain Marcial Howe, made the extremely risky offer to dig the graves and bury all those who died.  His justification for taking such a risk was because of a dream, or vision, that he claimed to have had, in which he caught the plague but then ultimately got better.  Eventually he did get sick.  But as he reportedly predicted, he apparently recovered and was very likely one of the small number of people who managed to survive the plague outbreak.

How on earth do people know these things? Can they actually happen? I have hardly ever been the kind of person who would rely very heavily on mental impressions upon the mind.  It has often seemed to me like too much of a superficial means of obtaining knowledge of anything.  But every-now-and-then, there are stories which crop up that do make one wonder.

From a biblical standpoint, it does not seem to be the kind of issue that has as much of a black-and-white fit as some other things do within various discussions of spiritual gifts.  For instance, Luke, the author of Luke's gospel and the book of Acts seems to be thinking of similar things when he records that Paul and Timothy were prevented by the Holy Spirit to pass through Asia ([Acts 16:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/100/ACT.16.6.NASB)).  Or when Paul says that &ldquo;... in every town the Holy Spirit warns me that chains and afflictions are waiting for me.&rdquo; ([Acts 20:23](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/ACT.20.23.CSB)).

It is uncomfortable to think that a time comes in some peoples' lives, that a time could come in my life, where I could be somehow warned about something before it happens, especially if it is something bad.  It is amazing how some people seem to know things, like when they are going to die; and then it actually happens the way they anticipate.  To put it loosely in the words of [Edmund Pevensie](https://narnia.fandom.com/wiki/Edmund_Pevensie) of [C. S. Lewis](https://www.cslewis.com/us/about-cs-lewis'/) [The Chronicals of Narnia](https://www.narnia.com/): [Prince Caspian](https://narnia.fandom.com/wiki/Prince_Caspian_(book)): &ldquo;It's worse than... being at the mercy of the telephone&rdquo;!
