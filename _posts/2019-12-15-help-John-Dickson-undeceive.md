Do you have abilities, or an interest, in writing clear, concise, articulate communications to the world at large? Even if you are not an academic, do you have knowledge of areas of philosophy, science, ethics, history, society and culture that could be contributed to a platform in a non-academic fashion? The following may provide a solution for you.

Historian, author and speaker [Dr. John Dickson](https://www.johndickson.org/bio) is opening up his [Undeceptions](https://undeceptions.com/) website to include more than just a podcast.  He is requesting submissions from people who want to help the world engage with the issues that ultimately point towards a defence of the Christian faith.

I am told they can be submitted in just about any document format, must be between 400-700 words in length and should be [emailed](mailto:questions@undeceptions.com] directly.

If you are up to the challenge, perhaps you might like to submit something and see if it makes it onto the website.  I think I will.
