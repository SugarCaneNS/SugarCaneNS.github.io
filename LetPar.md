Contained below are links to letters I have written to state and federal members of parliament concerning various economic and social political issues that are important to me. Feel free to use these as templates for your own letters if you find them helpful. My contact and other private information has obviously been removed but I have retained here the publicly-available snail mail contact info for the relevant MPs.

FYI: the base repository cloud storage for these files can be found [here](https://github.com/njsch/let2par).

### Transport and Climate/Net Zero Initiatives, With Their Impact Upon the Blind and Vision Impaired Community in Australia, Owing to Increased Introduction of [Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (EVs)](https://arena.gov.au/renewable-energy/electric-vehicles/)
You will find contained below links to copies of the LaTeX source, HTML and embedded PDF outputs. Note that while the HTML output may be accessible to screen readers, it is not guaranteed to maintain the best and most consistent presentation and formatting outputs, so it is best to use the PDF or use the LaTeX to compile yourself into whatever format you prefer.

Coming soon...
