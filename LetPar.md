Contained below are links to letters I have written to members of parliament concerning various economic and social political issues that are important to me. Feel free to use these as templates for your own letters if you find them helpful.

## Categorisation and Listing Conventions:
Letters are categorised by topical issue in the relevant headings, followed by the following loose [APA7-style](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/studying/study-support/referencing#tab__apa7-other-sources) reference convention in the links:
```
Surname, first initial. (year sent). Member division, government/parliamentary level [Letter].
```
