## Camel
Camel is a deliberately modified rendition of [an old MS-Dos game](https://siouxsays.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/your-camel-is-burning-across-the-desert-sands/), reportedly originally called Desert.  It is a fairly basic text-based console game, where the idea is basically that you are travelling through a desert, fighting thirst, sandstorms, villains, etc.  You have to look after yourself and your camel and make it across 200 miles worth of barren landscape without dying.

The game was ported to the BrailleNote mPower / Classic a couple of decades ago but is no longer maintained or supplied by the programmer who wrote it.  So I have re-written the program in Python, which also means that the game is now cross-platform and you can run it on Windows, Mac or Linux.

Download, installation, game play instructions and development information can be found on the [project site](https://njschmidt.id.au/camel).
