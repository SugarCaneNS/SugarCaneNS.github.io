## Camel
Camel is a deliberately modified rendition of an old MS-Dos game, reportedly originally called Desert.  It is a fairly basic text-based console game, where the idea is basically that you are travelling through a desert, fighting thirst, sandstorms, villains, etc.  You have to look after yourself and your camel and make it across 200 miles worth of barren landscape without dying.

The game was ported to the BrailleNote mPower / Classic a couple of decades ago but is no longer maintained or supplied by the programmer who wrote it.  So I have re-written the program in Python, which also means that the game is now cross-platform and you can run it on Windows, Mac or Linux.

Game re-development is still in early stages.  An Alpha pre-release can be [downloaded here from Github](https://github.com/njsch/camel/files/5879037/camel.zip), or otherwise you can either [clone the repository containing the source code directly](https://github.com/njsch/camel/), or alternatively, [download the code file over https](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njsch/camel/main/camel.py).

If you downloaded the binary (compiled program), just make sure that you keep all of the files inside the folder called &ldquo;camel&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;base_library&rdquo;, &ldquo;python37.dll&rdquo; and &ldquo;camel.exe&rdquo;.  To run the program, click or press enter on the file camel.exe.  If you are presented with the Windows smart screen after this then make sure that you activate the link or button that says &ldquo;more options / actions&rdquo; and then press the space bar or enter key to activate the &ldquo;run anyway&rdquo; button.  The program should run by itself but if it doesn't then you can always run it from the terminal / shell in Mac or Linux, or if running windows then you can run it from either the classic and almost legacy Command Prompt, or the newer and maintained Windows Powershell.
