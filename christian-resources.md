Contained on this page are some resources I have collated, partly for myself as it makes it easier to access them but also in the hope that others may find them useful.

## Bible Reading Materials
### Read the Bible in Self-interchangeable Lists Through Grant Horner's Bible-reading System
Say goodbye to Bible reading plans! Click [here](/horner-ten-lists/) to find out more.

### Audio Bibles
* Purchase solar-powered [audio Bibles through Megavoice](https://megavoice.com/audio-bible/) (their global site can be found [here](https://megavoice.com) and they have an [Australian website](https://megavoice.org.au) as well)

## Statements and Confessions of Faith
### The 2nd London Baptist Confession of Faith (2LBCF or 1689LBC)
This document was penned in 1677 by Reformed and Calvinistic Baptists in England; however, owing to religious freedom legal restrictions, the confessional document was not more formally, officially published until 1689, after the restrictions had been lifted. You can either view it below or [here](/2lbcf/) in a separate link.

## Resources for Blind and Vision (visually) Impaired Audiences
### Social and Health Aid to Developing Countries and Those in Need

* Prof. [Sarah 'Blake' Larose](https://www.sarahblakelarose.com) has some good resources on accessible Biblical language access and transcription. She has a Ph.D. in Biblical Hebrew. There is another individual from the U.S., namely Dr. Ray McAllister, who also used to have some resources available on a website; but I can't find it any more.
