Contained on this page are some resources I have collated, partly for myself as it makes it easier to access them but also in the hope that others may find them useful.

## Statements and Confessions of Faith
### The 2nd London Baptist Confession of Faith (2LBCF or 1689LBC)
This document was penned in 1677 by Reformed and Calvinistic Baptists in England; however, owing to religious freedom legal restrictions, the confessional document was not more formally, officially published until 1689, after the restrictions had been lifted. You can either view it below or [here](/2lbcf/) in a separate link.
