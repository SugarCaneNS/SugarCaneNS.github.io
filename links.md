Contained below, sorted by category but in no particular individual order, are some links that I find worth looking at.  I have placed them here hoping that you will as well:

## Blogs:

### Religion and Spirituality:
[Steve McAlpine](https://stephenmcalpine.com/) is a pastor from Perth who has a blog where he comments on political, cultural and spiritual issues of the day.  It is quite a popular blog, read and re-posted by other bloggers such as Tim Challies.
[Tim Challies](https://www.challies.com/) Is a Presbyterian minister from Canada who has been in the bloggersphere for a long time.  He has a very large archive of posts on a huge range of topics, with all sorts of reflection and practical counsel.
[Murray Campbell](https://murraycampbell.net/) is a Baptist minister from Melbourne who blogs about cultural and theological issues.  I find his posts quite helpful and informative on many issues.
[Dominic Steele](https://www.thepastorsheart.net/) hosts a series of interviews with other pastors at &ldquo;The Pastor's Heart&rdquo;.
[The Gospel Coalition](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/) Is an every-enlarging arthive of devotional and theological material.
[TGC Australia](https://au.thegospelcoalition.org/) is a similar resource but for a specifically Australian audience.
[Wade Burleson](https://www.wadeburleson.org/) is someone I have always found fascenating to read.  He blogs on a broad-ish range of issues such as history, theology, justice, politics and more.  In some ways he is possibly border-line [heterodox](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heterodox).  But especially from the standpoint of justice, he tends to talk about things that many others won't.

###Science and Technology:
Cosmologist and Astrophysicist Dr. Luke Barnes ([Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/staff_profiles/uws_profiles/doctor_luke_barnes)) [has a blog](https://letterstonature.wordpress.com/), where he discusses all things nature.  He specialises in the fine-tuning of the universe.
Aeronautical / Aerospace engineer James Garth has a Medium [blog](https://medium.com/@jgarth22) where he discusses science, history, apologetics and theology.
My Uncle [Stuart](https://stuartmcdonald.com.au/page6.html) is a behavioural exercise physiologist, counseller, and researcher who also has a [blog](https://medium.com/@stuartmcdonald_60154) which I am told is listed by Medium as a specialist blog.  He discusses all things health, psychology, philosophy and theology.

## Focussed Christian Ministries:
[Insight for Living](https://insight.org/), the Bible-teaching ministry of Chuck Swindoll, is a ministry that has sustained some of my own spiritual growth for a long time.  They also have an [Australian website](https://www.ifl.org.au/).
The same could be said of [Grace to You (GTY)](https://www.gty.org/) with John MacArthur.
[Ligonier Ministries](https://www.ligonier.org/) is also a helpful teaching resource with articles, books, and audio / video teaching material (sermons and lectures).

## Christian Apologetics Resources:
[Rev. Dr. John Dickson ](http://www.johndickson.org/bio) is an ancient historian, as well as an internationally renowned author and speaker.  His [website](www.johndickson.org), [public Facebook profile](https://www.facebook.com/john.dickson.9406417) and podcast &ldquo;<a href = "https://undeceptions.com/"> Undeceptions</a>&rdquo;' have been set up with a large focus on defending the Christian faith.  John's expert focus is on the existence and life of the historical Jesus.
James White's [Alpha and Omega Ministries (AOMin)](https://www.aomin.org/) has some great resources for dealing with other faiths and sects.
Nick Peters' [Deeper Waters](https://www.deeperwatersapologetics.com/) has some great interviews with Academics and Scholars within various fields of science, philosophy and theology.
