#### NOTE:
Although the original webpage (HTML document) looks fine as a stand-alone entity, Jekyll can't completely cope with the included html, which is not written by hand but is automated output produced from a typesetted LaTeX document.  Not sure how to fix this for now.

{% include 1689lbcf.html %}
